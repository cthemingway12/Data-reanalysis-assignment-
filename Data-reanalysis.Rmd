I reanalyzed data from a study published in 2013 by Jones et al.. This was a study done in fringe-lipped (frog-eating) bats investigating how the reliability of self-aquired prey cues affected the use of socially aquired prey cues. 

Here they trained bats to a novel cue (cell phone ring tone) and then manipulated the reward schedule of this cue. Bats were then assigned to different treatment groups that varied in their reward schedule for that cue. Individuals were then exposed to a conspecific tutor that was trained to a different cue, which was always rewarded, or just the different cue with no tutor.

There were five main components in this experiment: the intial training phase, a set of pre-tests, and experimental exposure phase, a set of post-tests, and a set of cue/location tests. 


```{r}
#bringing in the data
library(curl)
x1<-curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cthemingway12/Data-reanalysis-assignment-/master/sl.csv")
sl<-read.csv(x1, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(sl)
sl$v13
class(sl$v13)
sl<-na.omit(sl)
```

1. Experience tests:
```{r}
#Welches two-sample t-test comparing inital preference based on training between the two inital groups trained to A and B
#the author did this test with the intial training times for the bats but this data is not available. This analysis in not actually in the paper but was run to compare inital preferences for either call based on their training. Author used a GEE to analyze this in the paper, which I attempt below.
v5<-as.factor(sl$v5)
training<-sl$training

#Individuals trained to A
slA<-sl[sl$training == "A", ]
slA

slB<-sl[sl$training == "B", ]  
slB

mean(slA$v6)
mean(slB$v6)

#difference between the groups in number of approaches to trained cues:
t<-t.test(x=slA$v6,y=slB$v6, mu=0, var.equal=TRUE, alternative="two.sided")
t

#differences between the groups in number of approaches to novel cue:
mean(slA$v7)
mean(slB$v7)

t1<-t.test(x=slA$v7,y=slB$v7, mu=0, var.equal=TRUE, alternative="two.sided")
t1
```

2. Post-tests:
```{r}
#Fisher's exact test to determine whether proportion of individuals in different treatment groups approached novel cue in post test differently.
#proportion of bats that recognize novel cue in post-tests in the different treatment groups 
UTRA<-sl[sl$treatment == "UT-RA",]
UTRA
#2/6 individuals in UT-RA group recognized novel cue
RTRS<-sl[sl$treatment == "RT-RS",]
RTRS
#3/6 individuals in RT-RS group recognized novel cue
UTRS<-sl[sl$treatment == "UT-RS",]
UTRS
#3/6 individuals in UT-RS group recognized novel cue
m1<-matrix(data=c(2,3,3,6,6,6), nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
m1
fisher.test(m1, alternative = "two-sided")
#no significant differences between treatments in recognition of the novel cue

#proportion of bats that recognize trained cue in post-tests in the different treatment groups (column v10)
m2<-matrix(data=c(6,6,5,6,6,6), nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
m2
fisher.test(m2, alternative = "two-sided")

```

3. Cue/location tests:
```{r}
#t-test within the UT-RA treatment group to test for differences in preference for novel cue in the post-test and the cue/location tests

#one of these vectors has an na. 
#recreate individual vectors to pull out individuals who did not go through both treatments (na in the data set)

#not significant

t4<-t.test(x=v5,y=v6, paired=TRUE)
t4
#not significant

#Fisher's exact test comparing the number of bats in each treatment that approahed the novel cue in the opposite location 
#this data is found in column v15
#this column shows whether individuals appraoched novel cue in the recognition test and is coded for 0=no and 1=yes
UTRA
#0 out of 5 individuals flew to novel cue here
RTRS
#3 out of 6 individuals flew to novel cue here
UTRS
#3 out of 5 individuals flew to novel cue here
m12<-matrix(data=c(0,3,3,5,6,5), nrow=2, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)

fisher.test(m12)
#not significant
